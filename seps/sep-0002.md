# Use-variants: for packages with conflicting libraries

## The problem

The `intel-oneapi-mkl` package is installed with many libraries. Some
of these libraries define the same symbols but differ in their
implementation. For example there is a set of libraries built with
threading support, and another set which offers the same
functionality but are built without threading support.

Right now, the only mechanism Spack offers to choose between these
libraries is a variant: you could add a `threading` variant and then
choose which libraries to supply to dependents based on the value
of that variant. The problem with a variant is that different
variant values generate distinct installations of a package: we would
install `intel-oneapi-mkl` once for each choice of `threading`, even
though the installations would be the same.

## Proposed Changes

* Modify variant declarations with a flag to indicate that the variant
  determines how the package is used rather than how it is installed
* During concretization, this variant can be treated like any other
  variant.
* After concretization, the variant is stripped from the node and
  stored on the edge connecting the node to its parent.

## Example Use Cases

### Intel oneAPI MKL

Described in the introduction. This would be resolved by adding a
`threading` variant:

```
variant('threading', values=['openmp', 'sequential'],
        interface=True)
```

The new logic is the specification of `interface=True`: this
indicates that this variant describes how the package is used rather
than how it is installed.

Dependents do not have to specify a value for `threading`: if they
don't choose a value, then all dependents still need to "agree" on
using the same libraries. Both the new and old concretizer already
enforce consistency of variants amongst dependents.

### Boost

If users want to create a boost installation with many components,
then dependents may only need a subset of the Boost libraries; this
is a bigger issue if the unneeded Boost libraries define conflicting
symbols (not with one another, but with symbols defined in the
dependent or some sibling dependency of Boost).

Because Boost component libraries don't conflict with each other,
they do not need to be constrained like the dependents of
`intel-oneapi-mkl`. However, when we call
`root_spec['boost'].libs`, we want to know which libraries the
dependent actually needs: to handle this, the dependent can
recompute its dependencies based on its concrete spec, then pass the
dependency variants it requires as parameters to the dependency when
requesting `.libs`.

We could avoid doing this universally by marking variants where this
is a concern:

```
variant('regex', request=True)
```

This is not essential though: the dependent could universally
recompute dependency information without any hints from dependents.

### Intel Parallel Studio

This provides multiple virtual packages: `mkl`, `blas`, `lapack`,
`mpi`, and more. Each implementation has multiple sets of conflicting
libraries. If a dependent is only using `intel-parallel-studio` for
`mpi`, then we don't want use variants related to `mkl` to be
recorded.

This is murky pending a completed implementation of finer selection
of virtual providers: Currently we cannot say that we depend on
`intel-parallel-studio` *only* for `mpi` - if you ask for
`intel-parallel-studio` it is assumed that you are using it for
everything it provides (and there is no alternative `blas`
implementation for example).

Once there is a means of recording which virtuals are being used
by a dependent, we will want to only propagate an interface variant
to the dependent edge if the dependent actually uses the virtual
associated with that variant. For that purpose, I think it would
be suitable to name the associated virtual in the variant
declaration:

```
variant('threading', interface=True, provider='mkl')
```
