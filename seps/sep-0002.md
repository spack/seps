# Support multiple build-systems per package using a directive

## The problem

There are multiple packages that are either changing their build-system during the evolution of the project, or using different build-systems for different platforms. Spack, at the moment, provides no support to model this use case. As a result we wrote some [documentation](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/25174) to enumerate various workarounds that people adopted - each with its own drawbacks. What we would like to have in the long term is proper support for packages that can be built using multiple build-systems.

## Proposed changes

What we propose here to add support for packages using multiple build-systems is to __add another directive__ to the package DSL. If we take as an example `hdf5` this would look like:
```python
class Hdf5(Package):
    build_system('cmake', when='@X.Y:')
    build_system('autotools')
```
Each build-system can be subject to a constraint. In the example above, for instance, `cmake` can be used only if the version of `hdf5` is greater or equal than `X.Y` (while `autotools` is always available). 

We can also assume that there is an __implicit preference order__ based on on the order of declaration in the class. In the example above this means that, if no other requests are made by the user, `cmake` is preferred to `autotools` when available.

Build systems can be specified in specs using a key-value pair:
```
hdf5 build_system=cmake
```
__which requires the keyword `build_system` to be reserved by Spack__ (similarly to what is done for `dev_path`). It is interesting to note that modeling build-systems this way make them similar to signle-valued variants with the only difference that the set of allowed values is "dynamic" and subject to constraints.

__Each package needs to have one and only one build-system__.

### Overriding build-system phases

Some packages may need to override phases of the build-systems they use and there must be a way to specify which phase for which build-system is overridden. What we propose to use here is a decorator to distinguish among multiple build-systems:
```python
class Hdf5(Package):
    build_system('cmake', when='@X.Y:')
    build_system('autotools')

    @cmake
    def build(self, spec, prefix):
         pass
		
    @autotools
    def build(self, spec, prefix):
         pass
```
Using a decorator permits seamlessly to override phases with the same name.

## Implementation at a high-level

Currently the build-system specific methods are grouped in base classes and each package uses them via inheritance. There's a fair amount of machinery with metaclasses that is used to have dynamic phases for each build-system.

To support multiple build-systems we should probably add, as it happens in other directives, a dictionary of builder objects:
```python
hdf5.build_system = {
    'cmake': cmake_builder_obj,
    'autotools': autotools_builder_obj
}
```

Each builder object will accept a _package object tied to a concrete spec_ as argument and contain all the methods that are relevant for building it. 

The main idea is to:
1. Move things like `phases` and other similar methods into a class of their own
2. Use a different object for each package so that the package can override these methods if need be 
3. Have decorators that can monkey patch the object to customize the install phases

Dipatching to the correct build system object happens once we have a concrete spec associated with the package (since the spec coveys information about the build system, we know which one to select).

### Backward compatibility

Most of the packages are currently fine with a single build-system and they inherit almost all of the related methods from a base class:

```python
class OpenJpeg(CmakePackage):
	pass
```

To be backward compatible, if we push the methods and attributes down to a "builder" class, we can maintain the directives in the same base class:
```python
class CMakePackage(PackageBase):
	# Can be overridden if conditional in derived classes
	build_system('cmake')
	depends_on('cmake', type='build')
	
class CMakeBuildSystem(object):
    phases = [
        'cmake',
        'build',
        'install'
    ]
	
    @staticmethod
    def cmake(pkg, spec, prefix):
        pass
	
    @staticmethod
    def setup_build_environment(pkg, spec, prefix):
        pass
```
When we construct the package object we can check the methods defined on the package to see if there are overrides for the build-system being used, without the 
need to employ a decorator. 

We can special case this behavior to packages where there's only a single, unconstrained build-system and otherwise require the use of decorators for more clarity.
